# Client API

A simple CRUD API built as a backend learning exercise.

## 💻 About the project

This project is a basic client management API that implements a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) flow.

In practice, it allows you to:
- List clients with pagination
- Retrieve a client by ID
- Create new clients
- Update existing clients
- Delete saved clients

This repository primarily exists as a study project, focusing on understanding backend fundamentals.
