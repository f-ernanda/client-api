# Client API

A simple CRUD API built as a backend learning exercise.

## 💻 About the project

This project is a basic client management API that implements a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) flow.

In practice, it allows you to:
- list clients with pagination
- retrieve a client by ID
- create new clients
- update existing clients
- delete saved clients

This repository primarily exists as a study project, focusing on understanding backend fundamentals.

## 🎯 What I learned

While working on this project, my main focus was on:

- designing a simple CRUD API
- structuring routes and controllers
- handling basic data persistence
- understanding common backend patterns

It was an important step in getting more comfortable with backend concepts and API design.
